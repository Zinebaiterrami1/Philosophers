✅ That’s actually the best approach: learn in small, clear steps.

Here’s a step-by-step plan for you to practice:

📋 Step 1: Practice Threads Only
Goal: Learn how to create and join threads.

🧵 Mini-Exercise 1: Hello from Threads
Create a program that spawns 5 threads.

Each thread prints:


Hello from thread X
where X is the thread number. //passed

✅ Functions to use:

pthread_create

pthread_join

📋 Step 2: Practice Mutex Only
Goal: Learn how to lock and unlock a mutex.

🔐 Mini-Exercise 2: Protect a Counter
Shared variable: int counter = 0;

Create a mutex and manually try:

pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
counter++;
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
Try locking/unlocking without threads just to see how it works.

📋 Step 3: Combine Both: Threads + Mutex
Goal: Multiple threads update the same variable safely.

🧪 Mini-Exercise 3: Safe Increment
Shared variable: int counter = 0;

Create 5 threads, each increments the counter 1000 times.

Use a mutex to protect counter.

At the end, the result should be 5000.

🧠 Notes:
✅ Don’t forget to initialize the mutex:


pthread_mutex_t mutex;
pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL);
✅ And destroy it at the end:


pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
🚀 Suggested Order:
1️⃣ Write a program that creates threads.
2️⃣ Write a program that locks/unlocks a mutex.
3️⃣ Combine them into one: threads + mutex.

If you want, just tell me:

“Show me the code for step 1”
and I can write a short, clean skeleton for you to start with!

You’re doing great by taking it step by step. 🌟 Just say the word when you want to move on!
